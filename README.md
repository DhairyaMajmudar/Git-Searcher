## About Github Searcher

Github Searcher is a web application from which users can find the information of other GitHub users just by searching their usernames. 

Rather than using traditional REST API, the application uses the power of GraphQl Query to fetch only the required information from the API which results in decreased use of bandwidth and increasing performance.

Other than that being built on top of Nextjs makes the application server side, and using tailwind for styling makes the website look more modular and user friendly.

Type safety is taken utmost care with the help of TypeScript resulting in a decreased number of bugs.
